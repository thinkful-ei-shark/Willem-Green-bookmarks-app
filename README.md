USER STORIES:
As a user:

1. I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:

  title
  url link
  description
  rating (1-5)
  
2. I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app
    -This is accomplished with the main page opening and rendering each bookmark when the main page is accessed

3. All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating
I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view
    -This does work with the title of each bookmark being a button that does the expanding

4. Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link
    -This works as expected

5. I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list
    -Delete button is inside the expanded view

6. I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark
    -title and url are required, rating is defaulted to 5 so that it is always viewable

7. Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)

8. I can select from a dropdown (a <select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection
